# How to use Emojify?

Using **Emojify** is simple:

1. **Select a cell** in your Excel worksheet.
2. Go to the **Emojify** tab in the Excel ribbon.
3. **Pick an emoji** from the Emojify menu. The emoji will be inserted as an image in the selected cell.
4. You can **resize** the emoji or **reposition** it by dragging it, just like you would with any other image in Excel.
