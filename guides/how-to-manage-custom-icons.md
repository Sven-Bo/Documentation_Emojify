3. **Choose a Placeholder**: Select a slot (e.g., "Custom Icon 01") to save your image.
4. **Click ‘Create’**: If the slot already has an icon, you’ll be asked whether you want to overwrite it.

Here’s how:

1. **Click ‘Restore’** in the Custom Icon Manager.
2. **Done**: Icons will be restored from the backup folder (located in the same directory as the add-in).
